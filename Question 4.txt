Write a function that takes in string s where the function finds the first non-repeating letter in the string. Case sensitivity
matters so h is not equal to H. Only letters are passed in through the string.

Example

Input: potatO
Output: p

Input: bab
Output: a

Input: zZ
Output: z

Input: AAAAAAAq
Output: q
